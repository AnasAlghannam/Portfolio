  "batteryFaq1Question": "Can off-grid inverter work without battery?",
  "batteryFaq1Answer": "Yes, in some cases solar panel and inverter without a battery in this setup, the solar power converts sunlight into electricity, which is then converted by the inverter from DC to AC for immediate use. However, without a battery you can't store excess electricity. This means that after sunlight is insufficient or absent, the system won't provide power, and there will be no electricity at night or during cloudy or rainy days.",
  "batteryFaq2Question": "How long do off-grid batteries last?",
  "batteryFaq2Answer": "ROYPOW batteries typically last 10+ years with >6,000 charge cycles, providing reliable long-term energy storage.",
  "batteryFaq3Question": "How many batteries do I need for off-grid solar?",
  "batteryFaq3Answer": "The number depends on your energy consumption. You can connect up to 16 units in parallel for increased capacity.",
  "batteryFaq4Question": "What is the best battery for off-grid solar system?",
  "batteryFaq4Answer": "LiFePO4 (LFP) batteries are the best choice - they offer superior safety, longer lifespan, and better performance compared to lead-acid batteries.",
  "inverterProductTitle": "PowerBase E Series",
  "inverterProductSubtitle": "6500W Hybrid Inverter E-VoltX 6.5",
  "inverterProductDescription": "The ROYPOW 6500W hybrid inverter is ideal for off-grid living and backup power systems.

  "inverterFaq1Question": "What is an off-grid inverter?",
  "inverterFaq1Answer": "An off-grid inverter means that it works alone and cannot work with the grid. The off-grid solar inverter stores energy from the battery, transfers it from DC to AC, and powers electrical load equipment and use.",
  "inverterFaq2Question": "Can off-grid inverter work without battery?",
  "inverterFaq2Answer": "Yes, in some cases solar panel and inverter without a battery in this setup, the solar power converts sunlight into electricity, which is then converted by the inverter from DC to AC for immediate use. However, without a battery you can't store excess electricity.",
  "inverterFaq3Question": "What is the difference between hybrid and off-grid inverter?",
  "inverterFaq3Answer": "Hybrid inverters can work with both grid and battery systems, while off-grid inverters work independently without grid connection. Hybrid systems provide more flexibility but off-grid systems offer complete energy independence.",
  "inverterFaq4Question": "What is the best off-grid inverter?",
  "inverterFaq4Answer": "The PowerBase E Series offers excellent performance with support for up to 12 units in parallel, delivering 2X rated power for 10 seconds, IP65 rating, and intelligent monitoring capabilities.",
